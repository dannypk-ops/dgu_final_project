## üîç Overview

This project proposes a real-time, high-resolution **3D Digital Twin system** capable of reflecting environmental changes occurring in smart logistics environments. By integrating **ORB-SLAM3**, **COLMAP**, and **Gaussian Splatting**, our system can dynamically update and visualize 3D maps as the environment evolves ‚Äî without requiring full re-scanning.

The system is developed on **ROS 2 Humble**, and modularized into SLAM, Keyframe Update, and 3D Visualization nodes.

## üß© Key Features

- **Monocular ORB-SLAM3**: Extracts keyframes and constructs Covisibility Graphs from image sequences.
- **Keyframe Replacement Algorithm**: Dynamically updates the scene with newly acquired images.
- **Sparse Reconstruction + Gaussian Splatting**: Generates high-fidelity 3D visualization from updated keyframes.
- **ROS 2 Pipeline**: Real-time integration with actual robot systems.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My Contributions

I was responsible for the following core components of the system:

### 1. **Keyframe Update & Scene Graph Replacement**
- Developed a module to **insert new image sequences** collected from the robot into the global scene graph.
- Implemented a **Covisibility-based similarity comparison** to calculate shared ORB feature weights between new and existing keyframes.
- Designed a replacement logic using a **dynamic threshold (mean + std)** to selectively **replace outdated keyframes**.
- Ensured efficient integration with the SLAM system to reflect **local environmental changes** in the global map.

### 2. **Updated Keyframe-Based 3D Reconstruction**
- Converted the updated keyframe set into a **COLMAP-compatible format** for sparse reconstruction.
- Integrated **Gaussian Splatting** to generate smooth, high-resolution 3D representations from updated keyframe data.
- Focused on preserving **spatiotemporal consistency** across updates while minimizing computational overhead.

### 3. **Real-World Testing & Validation**
- Verified the system not only with robot-captured images, but also with externally recorded sequences.
- Confirmed the robustness of the pipeline under dynamic environmental conditions.
